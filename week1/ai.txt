Answer:

Nice — you’re getting the Codon-specific dict/NoneType failure. I’ll explain the root cause and give concrete fixes you can drop into your code (no back-and-forth questions — I’ll make reasonable assumptions and show safe options).

What’s happening (short)

Codon is telling you that None was used where a hashable dict key was required — and that the dict types were inferred as Dict[NoneType, NoneType]. Two likely problems (and both are common in Codon):

You actually tried to use None as a dict key (e.g. some function returned None and you did d[key] or key in d). In CPython None is hashable, but Codon’s runtime/type inference here treats None as unhashable in that context and errors when realizing hash operations.

Codon inferred the dict’s key/value types as NoneType because you created an empty dict ({}) without type annotations and Codon couldn't infer the intended types. That makes the dict type Dict[NoneType, NoneType] and then any real key (or internal hashing realization) triggers the error.

Both show up in your trace (realization of _dict_hash(key: NoneType) and the stack through __contains__/_add_node/_add_arc/_build), so you need to both prevent None keys and give Codon explicit types for your dicts.

Concrete fixes (apply one or all)
A — Make sure keys are never None

Add defensive checks before using a key:
# before inserting/using key
if kmer is None:
    raise ValueError("kmer is None — unexpected; check input data")
# or skip
if kmer is None:
    return

Example where you add node:

def _add_node(self, kmer: str) -> None:
    if kmer is None:
        raise ValueError("kmer is None in _add_node")
    if kmer not in self.nodes:
        self.nodes[kmer] = {}

Add similar guards in _add_arc and other places that call kmer1, kmer2, etc.
B — Give your dicts explicit types so Codon doesn't infer NoneType

Codon needs explicit typing when you initialize empty containers. Use typing or builtin generic syntax:

from typing import Dict, List

class DBG:
    def __init__(self, k: int, data_list: List[List[str]]) -> None:
        self.k: int = k
        # annotate node dicts: keys are strings, values are dicts or ints etc.
        self.nodes: Dict[str, Dict[str, int]] = {}   # example
        self.arcs: Dict[str, Dict[str, int]] = {}
        # ... rest of init

If your dict holds int counts keyed by string kmers:

self.nodes: Dict[str, int] = {}

If you use Python 3.9+ style:

self.nodes: dict[str, int] = {}

The important part: give the correct key/value types (e.g. str, int, or whatever your data are) instead of relying on {} alone.

C — If you must allow an optional key type, use Optional[...] and guard

If keys might legitimately be missing, type them as optional and avoid using None as the hash key:

Quick checklist you can run now

Search for {} initializations used for nodes, arcs, etc. Add type annotations on those assignments.

Add if key is None: guards where keys are created or used.

Add debug prints or raise exceptions where you first see suspect data from data_list.

Recompile in Codon and follow the (now clearer) error if it still points to a place — you’ll either get the offending None location or a corrected realization of dict types.

If you want, paste the relevant small snippets for __init__, _build, _add_node, and _add_arc (no need to paste the whole file) and I’ll give a line-by-line patch that you can copy into your code.

Prompt 2: 

OpenAI. (2025). ChatGPT (Sep 16 version) [Large language model]. https://chat.openai.com/chat
Prompt: "I'm trying to use a bash script to run my python files. I'm getting this result: + echo 'Dataset Language Runtime N50' Dataset Language Runtime N50 + echo ------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------- + printf 'data1 python time? ' data1 python time? + python genome-assembly/main.py data1 9990 But I want something more like: Dataset Language Runtime N50 -------------------------------------------- data1 python 0:20:00 9118 How can I get that result?"

Got it — right now your script is just echoing things literally and then running Python, so the numbers don’t line up in a table. What you want is:

A consistent tabular output (use printf instead of echo so you can format columns).

A way to measure runtime (e.g., /usr/bin/time or date before/after).

Capturing the N50 result from your Python script.

Here’s one way to do it:

#!/bin/bash

# Print header
printf "%-10s %-10s %-12s %-10s\n" "Dataset" "Language" "Runtime" "N50"
echo "-----------------------------------------------------------"

dataset="data1"

# Record start time
start=$(date +%s)

# Run your Python script and capture N50 (last line of output)
n50=$(python genome-assembly/main.py "$dataset")

# Record end time and compute runtime
end=$(date +%s)
runtime=$(( end - start ))

# Convert seconds to HH:MM:SS
runtime_fmt=$(printf "%02d:%02d:%02d" $((runtime/3600)) $(( (runtime%3600)/60 )) $((runtime%60)) )

# Print row
printf "%-10s %-10s %-12s %-10s\n" "$dataset" "python" "$runtime_fmt" "$n50"

Example output:

Dataset    Language   Runtime      N50
-----------------------------------------------------------
data1      python     00:20:00     9118

Notes

    %-10s means: left-align string, width 10 characters. You can adjust widths so it looks nice.

    If your Python script prints a lot and you only want the last line as N50, keep n50=$(python ... | tail -n 1).

    If you want a more accurate timing, replace the manual date calls with /usr/bin/time -f "%E" (elapsed real time).

Would you like me to show you the /usr/bin/time version (it directly gives you 0:20:00 style timing), or do you prefer the manual date arithmetic?
